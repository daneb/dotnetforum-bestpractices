## Scenario 5: Online Learning Management System

* Tech Stack: Django, Vue.js, MySQL
* Architecture: Monolith
* Domain: Platform for delivering online courses, quizzes, and student performance tracking
* Actors: Instructors, Students, Administrators

### Explanation: 
> The online learning management system's need for customizability and evolving educational trends warrant a transition to microservices. While the monolithic architecture has been effective, the demand for tailored features by institutional clients requires an architecture that can accommodate changes with minimal impact. Transitioning to microservices would allow for independent development of specialized modules while maintaining core functionalities across the platform. The ability to quickly adapt to educational shifts and accommodate diverse requirements outweighs the potential complexities introduced by microservices. While careful planning is required to avoid data inconsistencies and manage service communication effectively, the improved agility and customized experiences for both instructors and students make the transition a viable and valuable choice.
