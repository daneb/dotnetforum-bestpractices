## Scenario 2: Healthcare Management System

* Tech Stack: ASP.NET, Angular, SQL Server
* Architecture: Monolith
* Domain: Comprehensive system for managing patient records, appointments, and billing
* Actors: Doctors, Nurses, Patients, Billing Staff

### Explanation:
>Given the sensitivity of patient data and the need for stability and security in healthcare systems, continuing with the monolithic architecture is recommended. Transitioning to a microservices architecture could introduce complexities in data management, security, and compliance. The tightly integrated nature of the monolith ensures data integrity and minimizes the risk of data breaches. While feature development might be slower, healthcare systems prioritize stability and accuracy over rapid changes. Additionally, the transition to microservices could disrupt established workflows and negatively impact patient care. Instead, investing in modularization within the monolithic architecture, along with implementing efficient change management processes, would allow the healthcare management system to adapt to regulatory changes while maintaining the required level of security and stability.

## Questions
1. What are the primary concerns when considering a transition to microservices in a domain as sensitive as healthcare, where data security and patient safety are paramount?
2. How might a microservices architecture impact compliance with healthcare regulations and standards?
3. Can the monolithic architecture support the need for rapid adaptation to evolving healthcare regulations and requirements, or would microservices offer better flexibility?
4. What strategies can be employed to modularize the monolith while maintaining data integrity and security?
5. How might the transition to microservices impact the workflow of healthcare professionals and the continuity of patient care?
