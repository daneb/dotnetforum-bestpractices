## Scenario 3: Social Media Platform

> Suggested Outcome: Transition to Microservices

1. Rapid growth warrants a more modular architecture. Microservices can enable quick feature updates and support evolving user demands.
2. Microservices could accommodate different types of user-generated content. However, careful planning for data storage and retrieval mechanisms is necessary.
3. A well-designed data migration strategy and API contracts can ensure a seamless transition of user data to microservices.
4. Microservices could improve deployment speed and flexibility, but there might be alternatives within the monolithic architecture, like optimizing database queries.
5. Microservices can address scalability challenges by allowing specific components to scale independently. However, optimizing the monolith's codebase might be a more straightforward solution.
