## Scenario 5: Online Learning Management System

> Suggested Outcome: Transition to Microservices

1. The demand for customizability and specialized features is significant. Microservices enable institutions to tailor experiences without affecting core functionalities.
2. Ensuring seamless communication between microservices could be achieved through well-defined APIs and adopting an event-driven architecture.
3. Transitioning to microservices might improve development speed due to specialized teams. However, initial setup and communication might take time to stabilize.
4. The monolithic architecture might struggle to handle diverse content. Transitioning to microservices could enable better content management and delivery.
5. The shift to microservices might improve the student experience by allowing personalized content delivery. However, the transition should be managed carefully to avoid disruptions.
