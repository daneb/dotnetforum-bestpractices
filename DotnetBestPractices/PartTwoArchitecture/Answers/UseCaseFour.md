## Scenario 4: Financial Trading Platform

> Suggested Outcome: Continue as Monolith

1. The low-latency performance is crucial. Transitioning to microservices could introduce latency due to inter-service communication, affecting trading operations.
2. Maintaining consistent data across microservices could be challenging, impacting trading accuracy. The monolithic architecture ensures predictable data synchronization.
3. Secure inter-service communication protocols, like gRPC or event-driven messaging, can help maintain the required real-time trading performance.
4. Components like reporting or analytics might benefit from microservices, while the core trading engine should remain monolithic for performance reasons.
5. Transitioning to microservices could introduce unnecessary complexity and impact traders' confidence in the platform's stability, potentially leading to financial losses.
