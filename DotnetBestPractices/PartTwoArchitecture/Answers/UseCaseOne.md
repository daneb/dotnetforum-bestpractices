## Scenario 1: E-Commerce Platform

> Suggested Outcome: Transition to Microservices

1. It's critical for the platform to rapidly introduce new features to stay competitive. Microservices allow feature teams to work independently, speeding up development and deployment. 
2. The monolithic architecture might struggle to handle the anticipated growth during peak shopping seasons. Microservices can distribute load and scale components as needed. 
3. Transitioning might introduce challenges in data consistency and inter-service communication. Implementing an event-driven architecture and ensuring standardized APIs can mitigate these issues. 
4. Different teams focusing on microservices can foster specialization and innovation. However, effective communication and coordination between teams are vital to avoid fragmentation. 
5. Payment processing and inventory management could be potential microservices. They can communicate with the monolith using APIs to maintain core functionalities while gaining flexibility.
