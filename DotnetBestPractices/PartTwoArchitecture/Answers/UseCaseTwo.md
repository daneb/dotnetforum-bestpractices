## Scenario 2: Healthcare Management System

> Suggested Outcome: Continue as Monolith

1. The sensitive nature of healthcare data demands careful consideration. Rapid adaptation might not be the top priority, given the focus on data security and patient care.
2. Microservices could potentially complicate compliance efforts by introducing more points of interaction. The monolith's centralized control might offer better regulatory adherence.
3. The monolithic architecture might not be as agile, but careful modularization within the existing structure could maintain data integrity and security.
4. Modularizing specific modules, like patient billing or appointment scheduling, could offer some benefits without transitioning fully to microservices.
5. Transitioning could impact healthcare professionals' workflow and patient care continuity. Extensive training and a phased transition plan would be essential.
