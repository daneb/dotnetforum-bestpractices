# Dependency Inversion Simplified

**Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):** High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions (interfaces or abstract classes). Abstractions should not depend on details; details should depend on abstractions.

**Explanation with an Example:**

Imagine you're building a toy remote-controlled car. There are two main parts: the remote control and the car itself. Now, let's apply the Dependency Inversion Principle to design the communication between these parts.

1. **High-Level Module (Remote Control):** This is the part that you, as the user, interact with. You press buttons on the remote control to make the car move forward, backward, left, or right. The remote control doesn't need to know how the car's internal mechanisms work; it just sends commands.

2. **Low-Level Module (Car):** This is the actual car that receives commands from the remote control and performs actions accordingly. It has motors, wheels, and sensors that help it move as instructed by the remote control.

Here's how DIP comes into play:

- **Without DIP:** If the remote control directly knows how the car works (details), any change in the car's mechanics would require changing the remote control too. This creates a tight coupling between the remote control and the car's internals.

- **With DIP:** Instead of the remote control depending on the car's internal details, you create an interface (abstraction) that defines the basic actions the car can perform, like "move forward," "move backward," etc. The remote control depends on this interface (abstraction), not the car's specifics.

So, in this example, the Dependency Inversion Principle ensures that the remote control (high-level module) and the car (low-level module) communicate through an abstraction (interface) without tightly coupling them. The remote control sends commands using the interface, and the car implements the interface to carry out the actions.

Applying DIP like this makes your design more flexible: you can easily swap out different cars that adhere to the same interface without having to modify the remote control. Changes to the car's mechanics won't affect the remote control as long as the interface remains consistent.

In software development terms, DIP helps you design your classes and modules in a way that promotes flexibility, modularity, and easy maintenance by focusing on abstractions and minimizing direct dependencies.
