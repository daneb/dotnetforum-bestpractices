## Scenario 3: Social Media Platform

* Tech Stack: Ruby on Rails, React, MongoDB
* Architecture: Monolith
* Domain: Social media platform with user profiles, posts, comments, and messaging
* Actors: Users, Moderators, Admins

### Explanation: 
> The social media platform's rapid growth and scalability issues, coupled with the need for faster feature development, make transitioning to microservices a compelling option. While the monolith has served well, the complexity of managing user data and the demand for frequent feature updates call for a more modular architecture. Microservices would enable independent teams to work on specific functionalities, enhancing development speed and enabling the platform to scale more effectively during traffic spikes. While transitioning may require careful planning to extract user data and ensure smooth inter-service communication, the long-term benefits of improved agility, scalability, and faster feature releases would align well with the dynamic nature of a social media platform.

## Questions
Scenario 3: Social Media Platform

1. To what extent does the social media platform's rapid growth necessitate a more modular architecture like microservices?
2. How might transitioning to microservices affect the platform's ability to handle different types of user-generated content, such as posts, comments, and multimedia?
3. What strategies could be employed to ensure a smooth transition of user data from the monolith to microservices without compromising data consistency?
4. How would the transition to microservices impact the deployment process, especially considering the need for real-time updates and minimal service disruptions?
5. Can microservices help address the challenge of scalability during peak usage periods, or is there an alternative solution within the monolithic architecture?
