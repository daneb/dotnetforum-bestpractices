## Scenario 1: E-Commerce Platform

* Tech Stack: Java Spring Boot, React, PostgreSQL
* Architecture: Monolith
* Domain: E-commerce platform for selling various products
* Actors: Customers, Sellers, Admins

### Explanation
> The e-commerce platform has grown rapidly, and the monolithic architecture that initially supported all features is becoming difficult to scale and maintain. New features are requested frequently, and different teams manage various aspects of the application. Performance issues during peak traffic periods are a concern. Should the company transition to a microservices architecture to improve scalability, speed up feature delivery, and allow for independent service development? Or is the monolith still manageable and transitioning would introduce unnecessary complexity?

## Questions

1. What are some possible **tensions** in moving to a microservice architecture in your existing teams or in your experience? 
2. It is critical for the e-commerce platform to **rapidly introduce new features** to stay competitive 
3. Can the monolithic architecture support the anticipated growth in **traffic during peak shopping seasons**, or would microservices offer better scalability? 
4. What are the potential challenges of transitioning to microservices in terms of **data consistency and inter-service communication**, and how can they be mitigated? 
5. How might the development process change when different teams are responsible for **distinct microservices**? Will this impact collaboration or streamline feature releases? 
6. Are there specific aspects of the e-commerce platform that would be better suited as **microservices**, and how would these services interact with the existing monolith?
