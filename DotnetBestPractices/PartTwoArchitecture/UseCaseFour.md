## Scenario 4: Financial Trading Platform

* Tech Stack: C#, WPF, SQL Server
* Architecture: Monolith
* Domain: Platform for real-time financial trading, order execution, and portfolio management
* Actors: Traders, Analysts, Back-Office Staff


### Explanation: 
>The financial trading platform's primary focus on low-latency performance and real-time processing favors the existing monolithic architecture. While microservices might provide advantages in feature development speed, the inherent complexities introduced by microservices' inter-service communication and potential latency issues would be counterproductive in this domain. The monolith's tightly integrated nature ensures streamlined and predictable execution of financial transactions. Additionally, maintaining low-latency requirements and ensuring consistent performance across microservices could prove challenging. The trading platform should prioritize maintaining its competitive edge in performance and reliability, and therefore, the monolithic architecture remains the more suitable choice.

## Questions
Scenario 4: Financial Trading Platform

1. How critical is the platform's low-latency performance, and can this be maintained in a microservices architecture?
2. What potential challenges might arise in maintaining consistent data across microservices in a high-frequency trading environment?
3. How can the platform ensure secure and reliable inter-service communication to support real-time trading operations in a microservices setup?
4. Are there parts of the trading platform that could benefit from microservices, even if the core trading engine remains monolithic?
5. Would transitioning to microservices introduce unnecessary complexity that might negatively impact traders' confidence in the platform's stability?
