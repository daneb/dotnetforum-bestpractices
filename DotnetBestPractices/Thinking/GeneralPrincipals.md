9. Conway’s Law
10. Fail Fast
12. Ego-less programming
13. Make it work, make it right, make it fast CRAWL, WALK, RUN
14. The best code you can write, is not writing any at all
15. The best developer is the one who has had sufficient sleep (7+ hours).
16. Ensure consistency of implementation across code base
17. Make it work, make it right, make it fast CRAWL, WALK, RUN
18. The aim of agile is not to make the team go faster but to generate data to make improved decisions.
19. Comments usually mean you need to spend time cleaning the code. *regex
20. Goodhart’s Law
21. Correlation is not causation.
