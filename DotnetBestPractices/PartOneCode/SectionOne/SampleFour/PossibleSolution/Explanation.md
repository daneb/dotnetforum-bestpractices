In the original example, the `Ostrich` class is inheriting from the `Bird` class and overriding the `Fly` method with an exception, which means the `Ostrich` class doesn't follow the contract established by its base class. This violates the LSP because clients that expect a general `Bird` object (which should be able to fly) might receive an `Ostrich` object and try to call the `Fly` method, leading to unexpected behavior.

Here's an updated example that correctly follows the LSP:

```csharp
public interface IBird
{
    void Fly();
}

public class Bird : IBird
{
    public void Fly() { /* ... */ }
}

public class Ostrich : IBird
{
    public void Fly()
    {
        // Ostriches can't fly, so implement behavior accordingly or just leave it empty.
    }
}
```

In this corrected example:

1. We've introduced an `IBird` interface that declares the `Fly` method.
2. Both the `Bird` and `Ostrich` classes implement the `IBird` interface and provide their own implementation of the `Fly` method.
3. While the `Ostrich` class doesn't actually fly, it still adheres to the contract defined by the `IBird` interface, and clients can use the `Fly` method without encountering unexpected exceptions.

By ensuring that subclasses (like `Ostrich`) adhere to the behavior expected by the base class (like `Bird`), this example demonstrates the Liskov Substitution Principle.
