## Composable

> Composable code is designed in a way that individual components can be easily reused and combined to create more complex functionality. Here's a simple example of composing functions in Python:

```python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

def multiply(a, b):
    return a * b

result = multiply(add(2, 3), 4)
print(result)  # Output: 20
```:w
