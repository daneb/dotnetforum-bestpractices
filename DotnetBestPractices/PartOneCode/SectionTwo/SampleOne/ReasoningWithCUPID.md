## Reasoning with CUPID

Apologies for missing those aspects. You're absolutely right. Let's cover the CUPID properties you mentioned with relevant questions:

1. **Composability (C):**
    - Can the code's components (functions, classes, modules) be easily combined to create larger systems or solutions?
    - Are there clear interfaces and well-defined interactions between different components?
    - Does the code encourage the creation of reusable building blocks that can be assembled in various configurations?

2. **Unix Philosophy (U):**
    - Does the code follow the Unix philosophy of "Do One Thing and Do It Well"?
    - Are the code modules small, focused, and designed to perform specific tasks efficiently?
    - Are the components designed to work together seamlessly, promoting composability and simplicity?

3. **Predictable (P):**
    - Is the code's behavior consistent and reliable across different scenarios and inputs?
    - Are there edge cases or exceptional scenarios where the code might behave unexpectedly or fail?
    - Does the code handle errors and edge cases gracefully, providing meaningful feedback to users or other systems?

4. **Idiomatic (I):**
    - Does the code adhere to established coding conventions and best practices of the programming language and platform?
    - Are commonly used patterns and idioms of the language employed effectively?
    - Is the code written in a way that would be immediately recognizable and familiar to experienced developers of that language?

5. **Domain-Bound (D):**
    - Does the code exhibit a deep understanding of the specific domain or problem it's meant to address?
    - Are the naming conventions, terminology, and abstractions used in the code aligned with the language of the domain?
    - Does the code reflect the unique requirements and constraints of the domain it serves?

These questions based on the CUPID properties can help you assess code from various angles, including composability, adherence to Unix philosophy, predictability, idiomatic usage, and alignment with the specific domain. Evaluating code using these properties provides a comprehensive perspective on its quality, maintainability, and fitness for its intended purpose.
